# AI_Voice_Call_Agent
**AI Voice Appointment Booking Agent**  This project showcases a fully functional AI voice assistant built for a dentist clinic. Powered by **Vapi**, it acts as a virtual receptionist — intelligently handling inbound calls, answering FAQs, checking availability, booking appointments, and sending confirmations — all without any human involvement.


### **Objective**

The primary goal was to automate inbound appointment bookings for a dental clinic by building a conversational voice agent that sounds natural, responds intelligently, and manages the full booking flow from call to confirmation.

### **System Architecture**

The system integrates real-time voice processing with calendar and email workflows. Here's how it works:

1. **Inbound Call Handling**
    
    Vapi receives the call, transcribes speech, and uses LLM to generate intelligent responses.
    
2. **Conversational Flow**
    
    The agent greets the caller, answers FAQs, collects booking info, and confirms available time slots.
    
3. **Appointment Availability Check**
    
    Vapi makes a webhook call to **Make.com**, which checks availability in **Google Calendar** via API.
    
4. **Appointment Booking**
    
    Once the caller confirms, Vapi triggers a second webhook to **book the appointment** on the calendar.
    
5. **Email Confirmation**
    
    A third webhook is triggered to send a **confirmation email** to the clinic owner or doctor with all booking details.
